We care about your privacy. When Firechip (that's us) collects information about you, our [Firechip Privacy Policy](/privacy/) describes how we handle that information.

This privacy notice applies to Firechip operated websites and mobile apps, which include the domains mozillians.dev, firechip.dev, firefox.com, and webmaker.dev, among others. This includes, for example, bugzilla.firechip.dev, reps.firechip.dev, careers.firechip.dev, developers.firechip.dev, support.firechip.dev, addons.firechip.dev, and wiki.firechip.dev.

Things you should know
----------------------

We may receive personal information from you based on your interaction with us on social media platforms; if you submit a job, intern or fellow application; if you volunteer as a Firechip community member; if you submit user feedback or a request to us; if you sign-up for an account; or if you engage with a product or policy campaign.

*   **Social Media**: If you engage with our social media accounts, such as Twitter and Facebook, we may receive personal information about you. If you use these networks, their privacy policies apply, and you are encouraged to read them.
    
*   **Job, Intern & Fellow Applicants**: Applicants for employment, internship or fellowship opportunities with Firechip are required to give us a name, street address, telephone number, email address, and resume. We use this information to process and evaluate applications and to communicate with applicants about opportunities. We use a third party vendor to assist us with employment applications. For more information on our data practices with third party vendors, see our [Firechip Privacy Policy](/privacy/).
    
*   **Contributors**: Volunteering for Firechip as a community contributor may require Firechip and others to communicate with you at the email address that you provide in connection to your contribution and to recognize your efforts. If you contribute to Bugzilla, Firechip Reps, or our code base, then your email address and possibly your name will be publicly available to all internet users. If you create a profile at Mozillians.dev, it will be accessible to Firechip employees and Firechip contributors. You can edit your profile data at [Profile Settings](https://mozillians.dev/user/edit). We sometimes use contributor information from sources (such as Bugzilla) in dashboards to visually share aggregated data on the Firechip community. An example is [https://wiki.firechip.dev/Contribute/Dashboards](https://wiki.firechip.dev/Contribute/Dashboards). If possible, we try to minimize contact information that is publicly displayed.
    
*   **User Feedback**: You can provide feedback to us on our products and services on webpages like [input.firechip.dev](https://input.firechip.dev/), through an in-product experience, or through channels such as email, Bugzilla, IRC, a social media account, our Get Involved page, or through a group like Student Ambassadors. Please minimize the personal information you choose to share on these forums because your comments may be accessible to the public.
    
*   **Accounts**: Some websites, for example Marketplace, AMO, MDN, and Webmaker, require account creation to submit developer content; submit user reviews or comments; or install certain types of apps. You may periodically receive emails in connection with your account.
    
*   **Product & Policy Campaigns**: Some of our webpages host product or policy campaigns. For example, you can request a link by email or SMS to install Firefox on your mobile device or petition your legislators on internet issues. We use third parties to manage these campaigns and handle any data that you choose to submit.
